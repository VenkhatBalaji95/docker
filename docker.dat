Docker:

	* Basic commands:
			docker info --> List the full information about docker
			docker system df --> List the disk usage
			docker stat --> List the all containers statistics i.e., CPU, Memory usage etc,.
			docker system prune --> remove the unused data

	* Container commands:
			docker container pause containerID --> To pause the container. If the container is paused, we cant type anything inside the container
			docker container unpause container ID --> To unpause the container
			docker container stats containerID --> To list the statistics of a container.

	* Docker File:
			RUN --> Run contains the packages which needs to install. Run command will be executed while building the docker file.
			CMD --> CMD command will be executed while running the containers. If 2 CMD commands are present in the docker file, it will take the last CMD command while executing the containers. We can change the CMD parameters.
			Entrypoint --> It is also same like CMD, but we can't change the parameters. If we want to change the parameter, then need to pass the --entrypoint option while running the container.
			Copy --> It will copy the file from localhost to docker image
			Add --> It will also copy the file from local host to docker image but it will also unarchive the data.

	* Docker-compose:
			docker-compose config --> The purpose is to validate the compose file.

	* Docker Volume:
			docker volume ls --> To list down the volumes
			docker volume create volume_name --> To create a volume
			docker volume inspect volume_name --> To inspect the volume

	* Docker Network:
			The purpose is to communicate the containers with the host.
			If we do not mention the network, containers will use default bridge network.
			The Containers under default bridge network can communicate with each other by their IP's. It can't communicate with the containers by their container names under default bridge network.
